  <h2>Open Practices Learning Community</h2>
  <h4>Key pedagogy takeaways from my participation in an open practices learning community, May 17, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction3()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="May_20210517">
  <p>  Over the past six weeks I’ve had the pleasure to participate in an Open Practices Learning Community sponsored by the Sustainability Challenges for Open Resources to Promote and Equitable Undergraduate Biology Education (SCORE-UBE) group of the Qubes community (<a href="https://qubeshub.org">https://qubeshub.org</a>), led by Dr Karen Cangialosi (<a href = "https://karencang.net/">https://karencang.net/</a>).  Thanks to Karen and everyone who participated in this learning community!  I learned so much from your openness (pun intended) about successes, failures, hopes, and challenges in your own teaching.  </p>


  <p>My main understanding of “open” in an educational context has been “open educational resources” (OER), roughly speaking, replacing traditional costly textbooks with free online resources.  While OER is one aspect of “open” education, this learning community showed me there is so much more to it.  </p>

  <p> Here are two key takeaways I’d like to remember and incorporate in my classes.   </p>

  <p>Creation is the strongest form of learning.  Having students create authentic artifacts helps with equity issues and promotes open science.  Many created artifacts used online tools such as pressbooks, wiki education, or student / class websites. </p>

  <p> Here are a few examples of the amazing online resources created by students.  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> CORE 101 Open Pedagogy Project (<a href="https://sites.google.com/g.rwu.edu/core-101-open-pedagogy-project/">https://sites.google.com/g.rwu.edu/core-101-open-pedagogy-project/</a>"), started by Dr Heather S Miceli, Roger Williams University.  </li>
  <li>Tropical Marine Biology (<a href="http://tropicalmarine.cangialosi.kscopen.org/marine-biology/coral-reefs/">http://tropicalmarine.cangialosi.kscopen.org/marine-biology/coral-reefs/</a>"), Dr Karen Cangialosi, Keen State College</li>
  <li>Computational Neuroscience (<a href="https://mrgreene09.github.io/computational-neuroscience-textbook/">https://mrgreene09.github.io/computational-neuroscience-textbook/</a>), Dr Michelle Greene, Bates College.  </li>
  <li>Women in Antiquity (<a href="https://womeninantiquity.wordpress.com/">https://womeninantiquity.wordpress.com/</a>), started by Dr Chelsea A. M. Gardner, Mount Allison University, expanded on by others.  This last one is digital humanities, not STEM, but it has the same authentic creation and open scholarship fundamental to open pedagogy.  </li>
</ul>

  <p> I hate grading!  Of course I did not learn that during this learning community; I already knew it.  What this learning community reminded me was that I have other options.  I want to have assignments that help students learn.  I do not need to have assignments that get graded.  How do you sum up a student’s learning with one number, anyway?  I went down the rabbit hole the week we discussed ungrading.  I’ll just leave a recommendation here for  Hacking Assessment, Starr Sakstein, 2015, Times 10 Publications (<a href="https://www.10publications.com/HACKING-ASSESSMENT">https://www.10publications.com/HACKING-ASSESSMENT</a>).  </p>

  <p>Ungrading is a catchall term for methods of assessment that limit assigning completed work a number and almost no other meaningful feedback.  Instead, the focus is on methods of assessment that describe and encourage student learning.  On the extreme end is self-reflections throughout a course and a self-selected grade at the end.  Evidence indicates students are very good at understanding how much they learned during a course and giving themselves an appropriate final grade.  </p>

  <h2>My Covid-19 Pivot</h2>
  <h4>Some successes and failures during my Covid-19 pivot, May 10, 2021</h4>

  <p>Most people in higher ed experienced the shift from “normal” college classes to on-line courses as a result of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.  Starting in March 2019, through both semesters of 2020-2021 academic year, my courses were online synchronous.  Here’s a short summary of some of my successes and failures.   </p>

<p> I finished spring 2019!  While this may not seem like much, I was in a terrible mental space in March and April.  I consider finishing to be a true success.  When Marshall switched spring 2019 courses to online synchronous, there were four weeks remaining in the semester, plus final exams week.  After two weeks of online courses, I very seriously considered just quitting, ending my classes, not meeting for the remaining two weeks or having any other assignments.  I assumed no one would notice and if they did, they wouldn’t really care, except perhaps jealously wishing they had done the same.  I did finish, so pass over the gold star!   </p>

<p> I prepped a new course and flipped it at the same time.  Knowing fall 2020 courses would be online synchronous, I prepped a new course as a flipped classroom.  It took me the entire summer to design the lesson slides, create the lesson videos, and develop the pre-class quizzes on the lessons.  I also found and wrangled a real data set to be used in the course project.  What I didn’t get completed were the homework assignments, exams, or project details.  I think the course turned out well, but I spent a majority of the fall working on these.  Note to self: either don’t prep a new course as a flipped course or give yourself more time.   </p>

<p> I ignored student cheating.  Yes, you heard me.  While many of my colleagues were desperately trying to figure out how to stop students from using Chegg and other “illegal” resources, I just didn’t.  In fall 2020, when I noticed students had cheated on the first exam, I got angry, as we all do.  I thought to start the formal academic dishonesty process, but I decided to just let it go.  Yeah, I’m not happy about the fact that they cheated (and think they got away with it), but I did not have the time or mental energy to pursue the issue.  They know they cheated and if they’re ok with that, then so be it.  I know they cheated and if they ask me for a letter of recommendation, then certainly not.     </p>

  <h2>Reflections on Teaching</h2>

  <p>I have always tried to be a great teacher.  I wanted to present the material to my students in a way that they understood.  And now maybe you can see the problem.  I wanted to present the material.  The way I was taught math was through lecture.  I loved lectures, yeah, I’m that nerdy.  And so when I began teaching this was my main strategy for classes and, I’ll confess, in certain classes it still is.  If you would have asked me when I was an undergraduate, I’m sure I would have said I learned through lecture.  When I think back to my actual learning, it was sitting down with problems and working through them until I understood.  Active learning.  </p>

  <p>There is plenty of current education research that shows students don’t learn through lecture, they learn by doing.  (Sorry there’s no reference, but if you want one, or 20, just let me know.)  This is the main pedagogy I try to incorporate into my classes.  Active learning will engage students with the course material and help them learn.  But I want more.  </p>

  <p>When I first came to Marshall I taught several semesters of our quantitative reasoning class.  I thought the course was amazing!  When I went back a few years ago to see my course materials I was shocked.  They were terrible!  Sure the course had active learning during class and the course material is fantastic.  The material alone should make it really hard to have a terrible course and I had active learning – great right?  In some sense the course was great.  So what wasn’t great?   </p>

  <p>The course had great material and active learning, but nothing else.  The learning was entirely focused on the math, the official course material.  Now I want more.  I want the learning to move beyond the official course material.  I want to help my students develop into people who are good at and enjoy learning.  (I won’t suggest that I want them to love learning math – that’s just too much!)  I want them to feel that they have the skills necessary to succeed when they want to learn something for their job or maybe, in an ideal world, just for themselves.  </p>

  <p>Participating in WAC at Marshall has shown me that low-stakes reflections on learning can build the bridge between the course content and thinking about learning more broadly.  Even though I believe that low-stakes reflections can offer a lot of benefit in a tiny amount of time, I feel that I don’t do a good job of incorporating low-stakes reflection writing in my courses.  Taking class time for these short assignments takes away from my precious content time (my precious…).  I need to remember that I have other goals beyond content and class time will not be “wasted” by having students reflect on their learning process.    </p>

  <p>Random fun fact.  I found writing this section to be quite difficult.  I haven’t had to articulate my teaching pedagogy into a written coherent form since I was just out of grad school.  I decided on free writing about teaching, which turned into about 900 words.  I was hoping if I tossed enough junk on my paper, I could edit that down to a reasonable teaching statement.  (Is this what students usually hope, too?)  In the end, I used about three sentences of those 900 words in my final reflection.  So, I didn’t use the content of the free writing, just the organization that was somehow brought about by my disorganized rambling thoughts.  I don’t typically use free writing, so I didn’t realize how wonderfully it could work.  Thanks writing pedagogies!  </p>

  <p>May the 4th be with you.</p>
