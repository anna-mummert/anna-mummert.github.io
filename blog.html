  <h2>Statistical Variable Types – Some History and My Thoughts</h2>
  <h4>A quest to present a coherent, relevant list of variable types in introductory statistics, June 14, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction7()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="June_20210614">
  <p>  I’m on a quest today to understand the types of variables in statistical studies.  I’ll be teaching an introductory statistics class in the fall and need a clear, consistent approach to take with the students.</p>
  <p>While questing, I was happy to discover a bit of history surrounding types of variables, also known as levels of measurement.  The well-known four levels of measurement – nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio – were developed in the 1940s by psychologist Stevens (<a href=” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement”>Level of measurement</a> (URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)).  This classification is surrounded by criticism.  Many other classification systems with more or different classifications have been developed.  Moreover, textbooks and online sources have multiple classification systems.</p>
  <p>The four levels of measurement of Stevens does a good job of separating variables into groups based on arithmetic operations.
  <ul>
  <li> Nominal variables – no arithmetic operations can be performed
  <li> Ordinal variables – ordering can be performed, only
  <li> Interval variables – ordering and differences can be performed, only
  <li> Ratio variables – ordering, differences, and ratios can be performed.
  </ul>
  I think it’s fair to say that Stanley was thinking about the statistical operations that could be performed in the 1940s.  (Confession – I didn’t read Stanley’s paper and don’t know what he was thinking about, but framing his levels in terms of allowable statistical operations is what we want to do.)  For example, it makes perfect sense to say that 60 degrees is 40 degrees more than 20 degrees (difference), but not that 60 degrees is three times warmer than 20 degrees (ratio).  Great, so we have temperature must be an interval variable.</p>
  <p>My colleagues claim that the difference between interval and ratio variables are difficult for the students to determine.  This makes sense.  It is difficult.  Case in point, temperature can be measured in degrees Fahrenheit (interval) or Kelvin (ratio).  Sigh…  Thus my personal quest for clarity.</p>
  <p>Since the 1940s statistical understanding, tools, and computational power has grown.  These four levels of measurement no longer capture the salient features of data.  What to use instead?</p>
  <p>Other modern classification systems continue to focus on classifying data into groups based on the statistics that can be performed on that data type.  A very nice description is given by Jeff Hale in <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/7-data-types-a-better-way-to-think-about-data-types-for-machine-learning-939fae99a689"> 7 Data Types: A Better Way to Think about Data Types for Machine Learning</a>, Aug 29, 2018, Towards Data Science.  Reading all the way through, you will find that Jeff suggests 11 data types for the modern digital age: useless, nominal, binary, ordinal, count, time, interval, image, video, audio, and text.</p>
  <p>I like that time is separated out into it’s own group; it really does have unique properties.  The addition of image, video, audio, and text are well beyond the scope of an intro stats class.  I’ll leave them here for the interested reader, but I’ll be ignoring them.</p>
  <p>There are other ways to think about variables in statistics, such as explanatory or extraneous.  Two very extensive lists for you to review are at <a href = “https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/types-of-variables”>10 Types of Variables in Research and Statistics</a>, Indeed Editorial Team, March 29, 2021 and <a href=” https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/types-of-variables/”>A List of Common and Uncommon Types of Variables</a> Stephanie Glen, StatisticsHowTo.com: Elementary Statistics for the rest of us!.</p>
  <p>Check out next week (June 21, 2021) where I’ll let you know the approach I’ll take during my fall class.</p>

  <h2>Personal Goals for Blogging </h2>
  <h4>Thoughts on why I started on this blogging journey, June 07, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction6()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="June_20210607">
  <p>I’ve thought often about blogging, but rarely had the time to get it going.  I was too busy running on the hamster wheel – teaching, research, and service – of tenure and promotion.  I saw no measurable outcomes (for T&P) of blogging.  I thought of such reflective writing as useless and so it never happened.  </p>
<p>As I do every summer, I have a list of goals that I’m planning (hoping, really) to complete.  This summer I gave myself very modest goals.  The two big ones are to put final touches on a mostly completed big service project and prepare classes for the fall.  In particular, please note my goals include no research.  (This is not entirely true; I do have a goal for research this summer.  My research program was non-existent this past academic year - yours too?? - and my summer research goals are to think about what project I’d like to start doing this fall.)</p>
<p>As part of my plans for open pedagogy, I want to move away from our university learning management system.  I remember a golden age of sharing course resources when I was in graduate school.  Faculty had webpages with course materials.  Then came the learning management systems and materials went behind logins, accessible by those in the courses only.  I have a personal goal to get back to sharing.  I’ll be posting my course materials online – accessible to all (admittedly only those with internet access), free to all.  </p>
<p>Obviously, I need to have a webpage.  I went with GitHub (<a href = "https://github.com">https://github.com</a>) because it’s free and I can code pages with html.  I’m not against paying for services I use, but I wanted to try out course webpages before committing money (you know... just in case it’s a true disaster).  So when I designed the webpage earlier this summer I thought it would be a good time to start the blog.  </p>
<p>My overarching goal for these blogs is to give myself a space to reflect on teaching, research, service, and general faculty academic life.  The focus has been only on teaching so far because that is my main goal for the summer.  I would like to reflect on research and service, too, so stay tuned!  I’d like to make a post once a week – on Monday’s.  The blogs should be about 400 words - a significant length, but not too long.  </p>
<p>I love writing and I’m excited about the self-discipline that will be required to write a personal blog post each week, the discipline to be reflective, open with you and gracious to myself about both success and failures, and the time to write the posts.  Though relatively short, the posts take several hours each to draft, edit, and include in the html source code (with appropriate hyperlinks, etc).  So far this summer, it has been no problem to devote a few hours to this task, but I am concerned about when the semester starts.  It seems daunting to think about “giving up” several hours each week to do this seemingly useless task.

  <h2>Podcasts and Other Educational Resources while Running - Part 2</h2>
  <h4>Two podcasts I've enjoyed while running, June 02, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction5()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="June_20210602">
  <p> The second podcast I subscribed to is <a href ="https://teachinginhighered.com/">Teaching in Higher Ed</a>, hosted and produced by Dr Bonni Stachowiak.  I started as far back as my podcast app would allow – Episode 061 from 2015, All That is Out of Our Control with Lee Skallerup Bessette.  (Will get back to the first ones sometime…)  I love that Bonni and her guests are open about their failures (and successes) as teachers.  It makes me feel better about my own struggles to be the best I can be for myself and my students.  Here are a few recommendations so far (but I confess the episodes are “running” together a bit in my mind).  </p>

  <p>Episode 64 – The Weekly Review.  Bonni outlines an ambitious organizational and reflection tool she uses each week.  Though I don’t think I’m ready to jump in fully, I can see the benefit of taking a step back and assessing your own work and life.  This is what we’d like our students to do with their learning, so why not ask it of ourselves as well?  </p>

  <p>Episode 73 – Team-Based Learning with Jim Sibley.  Jim shares his experiences with using class time for students to work in teams to make decisions on authentic problems.  The “make decisions” part of the team work is the key to his recommendations.  </p>

  <p>Episode 77 – Teaching What You Don’t Know with Therese Huston.  One rarely discussed part of teaching in higher education is that we teach what we don’t know well – one topic, a whole course, or a set of students.  Therese shares practical tips on how to survive the prep time and create a successful course.  I bought Therese’s book <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066175">Teaching What You Don’t Know</a>, Therese Huston, 2012, Harvard University Press!  </p>

  <p>I’ll make a confession.  Things I’m just now learning about how to teach well, Bonni was already discussing in 2015.  Gulp!  </p>

  <p>Here are a few of the effect of listening to podcasts and educational resources while running.  I’m getting slower, not faster, but I’m going to eliminate “running faster” from my f*cks budget <a href="#footnote_20210601">[1]</a> and just enjoy myself.  I’m multitasking!  Multitasking is not really a goal of mine, but now I’m enjoying a nice run and improving my teaching.  Is this what people mean when they say they’re working from home?  </p>

  <p id = "footnote_20210601" style = "font-size:10pt">
  [1] I also listened to <a href="http://nofucksgivenguides.com">The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck: How to Stop Spending Time You Don’t Have with People You Don’t Like Doing Things You Don’t Want to Do (A No F*cks Given Guide)</a>, by Sarah Knight, 2015, Confer Books.  Again, thanks Sarah for helping me make it through the lockdown! <p>

  <h2>Podcasts and Other Educational Resources while Running - Part 1</h2>
  <h4>Two podcasts I've enjoyed while running, May 24, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction4()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="May_20210524">
  <p> In March 2020, when my YMCA shut down, I hit the streets running.  I’d been working slowly to build up my running time and speed over the previous year or so.  In the fall 2019, I very safely used a treadmill while watching <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_GameDay_(football_TV_program)">College Game Day</a> on ESPN (*nostalgic sigh).  I’ve been consistently running since then.  I needed the exercise and the mental clarity.  (Did you read my post from May 10, 2021, where I mentioned some really terrible teaching that happened, even with the running endorphins?)  I discovered the joys of podcasts and audiobooks while running.  <p>

  <p>To help with my mental clarity, I started listening to the <a href = "https://www.happinesslab.fm/">Happiness Lab</a>, by Dr Laurie Santos, produced by <a href = "https://www.pushkin.fm/">Pushkin Industries</a>.  Big shout out to Laurie – I’m not sure I would have made it through the early months of the pandemic lockdown without her!  The Happiness Lab warms my academic heart.  Laurie presents scientific research for what really makes people happy and it’s not what you think.  To get you started on your happiness journey, here are two episodes from Season 1 that resonated with me during the pandemic lockdown.  </p>

  <p>Episode 4 – Mistakenly Seeking Solitude.  The pandemic lockdown forced us to isolate and we all lost the joy of speaking with strangers (and not strangers!).  </p>

  <p>Episode 8 – Choice Overload.  Switching to online synchronous courses was nothing but choice after choice.  It was unbearable.  </p>

  <p>I said this post would be about educational resources.  To paraphrase the host of my second podcast (see next week) teachers need to have more peace in their lives to be more present for their students.  So The Happiness Lab qualifies as educational professional development.  The Happiness Lab was the first podcast I subscribed to and have delivered with my iPhone Podcasts app.  I am a luddite.  Last week <i>for the first time</i> I use bluetooth headphones to talk with someone on the phone.  (Not on purpose, it was an accident, I swear.) </p>

  <h2>Open Practices Learning Community</h2>
  <h4>Key pedagogy takeaways from my participation in an open practices learning community, May 17, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction3()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="May_20210517">
  <p>  Over the past six weeks I’ve had the pleasure to participate in an Open Practices Learning Community sponsored by the Sustainability Challenges for Open Resources to Promote and Equitable Undergraduate Biology Education (SCORE-UBE) group of the Qubes community (<a href="https://qubeshub.org">https://qubeshub.org</a>), led by Dr Karen Cangialosi (<a href = "https://karencang.net/">https://karencang.net/</a>).  Thanks to Karen and everyone who participated in this learning community!  I learned so much from your openness (pun intended) about successes, failures, hopes, and challenges in your own teaching.  </p>


  <p>My main understanding of “open” in an educational context has been “open educational resources” (OER), roughly speaking, replacing traditional costly textbooks with free online resources.  While OER is one aspect of “open” education, this learning community showed me there is so much more to it.  </p>

  <p> Here are two key takeaways I’d like to remember and incorporate in my classes.   </p>

  <p>Creation is the strongest form of learning.  Having students create authentic artifacts helps with equity issues and promotes open science.  Many created artifacts used online tools such as pressbooks, wiki education, or student / class websites. </p>

  <p> Here are a few examples of the amazing online resources created by students.  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> CORE 101 Open Pedagogy Project (<a href="https://sites.google.com/g.rwu.edu/core-101-open-pedagogy-project/">https://sites.google.com/g.rwu.edu/core-101-open-pedagogy-project/</a>"), started by Dr Heather S Miceli, Roger Williams University.  </li>
  <li>Tropical Marine Biology (<a href="http://tropicalmarine.cangialosi.kscopen.org/marine-biology/coral-reefs/">http://tropicalmarine.cangialosi.kscopen.org/marine-biology/coral-reefs/</a>"), Dr Karen Cangialosi, Keen State College</li>
  <li>Computational Neuroscience (<a href="https://mrgreene09.github.io/computational-neuroscience-textbook/">https://mrgreene09.github.io/computational-neuroscience-textbook/</a>), Dr Michelle Greene, Bates College.  </li>
  <li>Women in Antiquity (<a href="https://womeninantiquity.wordpress.com/">https://womeninantiquity.wordpress.com/</a>), started by Dr Chelsea A. M. Gardner, Mount Allison University, expanded on by others.  This last one is digital humanities, not STEM, but it has the same authentic creation and open scholarship fundamental to open pedagogy.  </li>
</ul>

  <p> I hate grading!  Of course I did not learn that during this learning community; I already knew it.  What this learning community reminded me was that I have other options.  I want to have assignments that help students learn.  I do not need to have assignments that get graded.  How do you sum up a student’s learning with one number, anyway?  I went down the rabbit hole the week we discussed ungrading.  I’ll just leave a recommendation here for  Hacking Assessment, Starr Sakstein, 2015, Times 10 Publications (<a href="https://www.10publications.com/HACKING-ASSESSMENT">https://www.10publications.com/HACKING-ASSESSMENT</a>).  </p>

  <p>Ungrading is a catchall term for methods of assessment that limit assigning completed work a number and almost no other meaningful feedback.  Instead, the focus is on methods of assessment that describe and encourage student learning.  On the extreme end is self-reflections throughout a course and a self-selected grade at the end.  Evidence indicates students are very good at understanding how much they learned during a course and giving themselves an appropriate final grade.  </p>

  <h2>My Covid-19 Pivot</h2>
  <h4>Some successes and failures during my Covid-19 pivot, May 10, 2021</h4>
  <p>
  <button class = "w3-black w3-button" onclick="myFunction2()"> Read post </button></p>
  <div id="May_20210510">

  <p>Most people in higher ed experienced the shift from “normal” college classes to on-line courses as a result of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.  Starting in March 2019, through both semesters of 2020-2021 academic year, my courses were online synchronous.  Here’s a short summary of some of my successes and failures.   </p>

<p> I finished spring 2019!  While this may not seem like much, I was in a terrible mental space in March and April.  I consider finishing to be a true success.  When Marshall switched spring 2019 courses to online synchronous, there were four weeks remaining in the semester, plus final exams week.  After two weeks of online courses, I very seriously considered just quitting, ending my classes, not meeting for the remaining two weeks or having any other assignments.  I assumed no one would notice and if they did, they wouldn’t really care, except perhaps jealously wishing they had done the same.  I did finish, so pass over the gold star!   </p>

<p> I prepped a new course and flipped it at the same time.  Knowing fall 2020 courses would be online synchronous, I prepped a new course as a flipped classroom.  It took me the entire summer to design the lesson slides, create the lesson videos, and develop the pre-class quizzes on the lessons.  I also found and wrangled a real data set to be used in the course project.  What I didn’t get completed were the homework assignments, exams, or project details.  I think the course turned out well, but I spent a majority of the fall working on these.  Note to self: either don’t prep a new course as a flipped course or give yourself more time.   </p>

<p> I ignored student cheating.  Yes, you heard me.  While many of my colleagues were desperately trying to figure out how to stop students from using Chegg and other “illegal” resources, I just didn’t.  In fall 2020, when I noticed students had cheated on the first exam, I got angry, as we all do.  I thought to start the formal academic dishonesty process, but I decided to just let it go.  Yeah, I’m not happy about the fact that they cheated (and think they got away with it), but I did not have the time or mental energy to pursue the issue.  They know they cheated and if they’re ok with that, then so be it.  I know they cheated and if they ask me for a letter of recommendation, then certainly not.     </p>

  <h2>Reflections on Teaching</h2>
  <h4>Reflections on teaching submitted as part of my Writing Across the Curriculum portfolio, May 4, 2021</h4>

<div id="May_20210504">

  <p>I have always tried to be a great teacher.  I wanted to present the material to my students in a way that they understood.  And now maybe you can see the problem.  I wanted to present the material.  The way I was taught math was through lecture.  I loved lectures, yeah, I’m that nerdy.  And so when I began teaching this was my main strategy for classes and, I’ll confess, in certain classes it still is.  If you would have asked me when I was an undergraduate, I’m sure I would have said I learned through lecture.  When I think back to my actual learning, it was sitting down with problems and working through them until I understood.  Active learning.  </p>

  <p>There is plenty of current education research that shows students don’t learn through lecture, they learn by doing.  (Sorry there’s no reference, but if you want one, or 20, just let me know.)  This is the main pedagogy I try to incorporate into my classes.  Active learning will engage students with the course material and help them learn.  But I want more.  </p>

  <p>When I first came to Marshall I taught several semesters of our quantitative reasoning class.  I thought the course was amazing!  When I went back a few years ago to see my course materials I was shocked.  They were terrible!  Sure the course had active learning during class and the course material is fantastic.  The material alone should make it really hard to have a terrible course and I had active learning – great right?  In some sense the course was great.  So what wasn’t great?   </p>

  <p>The course had great material and active learning, but nothing else.  The learning was entirely focused on the math, the official course material.  Now I want more.  I want the learning to move beyond the official course material.  I want to help my students develop into people who are good at and enjoy learning.  (I won’t suggest that I want them to love learning math – that’s just too much!)  I want them to feel that they have the skills necessary to succeed when they want to learn something for their job or maybe, in an ideal world, just for themselves.  </p>

  <p>Participating in WAC at Marshall has shown me that low-stakes reflections on learning can build the bridge between the course content and thinking about learning more broadly.  Even though I believe that low-stakes reflections can offer a lot of benefit in a tiny amount of time, I feel that I don’t do a good job of incorporating low-stakes reflection writing in my courses.  Taking class time for these short assignments takes away from my precious content time (my precious…).  I need to remember that I have other goals beyond content and class time will not be “wasted” by having students reflect on their learning process.    </p>

  <p>Random fun fact.  I found writing this section to be quite difficult.  I haven’t had to articulate my teaching pedagogy into a written coherent form since I was just out of grad school.  I decided on free writing about teaching, which turned into about 900 words.  I was hoping if I tossed enough junk on my paper, I could edit that down to a reasonable teaching statement.  (Is this what students usually hope, too?)  In the end, I used about three sentences of those 900 words in my final reflection.  So, I didn’t use the content of the free writing, just the organization that was somehow brought about by my disorganized rambling thoughts.  I don’t typically use free writing, so I didn’t realize how wonderfully it could work.  Thanks writing pedagogies!  </p>

  <p>May the 4th be with you.</p>
