<h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2>

<p>I loved lectures when I was a student, yeah, I’m that nerdy.  And so when I began teaching this was my main strategy for classes and, I’ll confess, in certain classes it still is.  If you would have asked me when I was an undergraduate, I’m sure I would have said I learned through lecture.  When I think back to my actual learning, it was sitting down with problems and working through them until I understood.  Active learning.  Active learning is the main pedagogy I try to incorporate into my classes.  Another true confession - I know I don't always succeed. </p>

<!--
<p>I've recently been participating in the 6-session Learning Community series Educating our Next Generation of Scientists: Open Educational Practices, Open Science and Social Justice Learning Community led by Dr. Karen Cangialosi.  This community has been exactly what I needed to focus in on true student learning and social justice.  In fall 2021, I'll be teaching intro stats for the first time with a focus on social justice.
